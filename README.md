# Election Data Analysis and Prediction System
------------------------------------------


## Overview
- This project is designed to analyze election-related data, perform sentiment analysis, and predict election outcomes based on various features. The system consists of three main components: the front-end built using React, the middleware using an LLM for query generation and data processing, and the back-end which stores and retrieves data from a MySQL database. Machine learning models are employed for prediction, and data visualization is implemented via ChartJS.

## Architecture
- The system is divided into three major sections: Front-End, Middleware, and Back-End. Here's how each component interacts:

### Front-End (React)

- Data Analysis:
Users can select a year, state, and constituency, which will generate SQL queries to retrieve data.
The results are displayed as bar graphs using ChartJS.
- Sentiment Analysis:
Users can select a political party, and the system will fetch sentiment scores, which are calculated using polarity and subjectivity analysis.
Results are visualized as pie charts with ChartJS.
 - Prediction:
Users can select a question about election predictions, and the system will display results generated by the machine learning models.
    

### Middleware
- Query Processing:

User selections are passed as prompts to a Language Learning Model (LLM) called PHI3 LLM. The LLM converts prompts into SQL queries.
- Sentiment Score Calculation:

For sentiment analysis, TextBlob is used to compute the polarity and subjectivity based on data sourced from Google News and Kaggle datasets.
- Prediction Models:

A voting regressor is employed to predict election outcomes based on features like sentiment, approval ratings, leader popularity, social media influence, and more.
The models used are Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor.

### Back-End
- Data Storage and Retrieval:
A MySQL database stores the election data (historical data from 2019 and sentiment data from 2024).
- Data Sources:
Data is sourced from Kaggle datasets and Google News, which are integrated into the system for analysis and prediction.

## Machine Learning Models 

### Random Forest Regressor:
Used to predict election results based on multiple decision trees and aggregated voting.

### Gradient Boosting Regressor:
Combines weak prediction models into a strong learner for improving election prediction accuracy.

### Voting Regressor:
An ensemble method that combines the results of multiple models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to improve prediction accuracy.


## Data Visualization
- Data visualization is a critical part of the system to help users interpret the results easily. The visualization is handled through ChartJS for the following purposes:
    - Bar Graphs for election data comparisons.
    - Pie Charts for sentiment analysis.
## Datasets Used
- 2019 Election Data: Historical data regarding election results, party features, etc.

- 2024 Sentiment Data: Data from Google News and Kaggle, processed for sentiment analysis.

## Technologies Used
- Front-End: React, ChartJS
- Middleware: LLM (PHI3), SQL, TextBlob
- Back-End: MySQL, Kaggle Datasets, Google News
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Voting Regressor)

## Installation and Setup
